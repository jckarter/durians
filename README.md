# Durian C++11 libraries

This is a collection of MIT-licensed, header-only C++11 libraries. To use, simply add the
`include` directory to your header search path. A test suite is included in the `test`
directory; to build and run, simply compile using a command similar to the following:

```
clang++ -Iinclude -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ test/*.cpp
./a.out
```

The test program will print `ok` if successful, or abort with an assertion failure if a test
fails.

These libraries are primarily developed and tested with Xcode 4.4, using Clang and the libc++
standard library.

All symbols described below are defined in the `durians` namespace unless specified otherwise.
Preprocessor macros are of course not namespaced.

## durians/enum_meta.hpp

This header provides preprocessor macros for defining `enum` types with facilities for converting
to and from string representations of the member names. To define an enum, define a macro
named `META_MEMBERS_TypeName(member)` as follows:

```c++
#define META_MEMBERS_TypeName(member) \
    member(FOO, 0) \
    member(BAR, 1) \
    member(BAS, 2)
```

Then define the type by invoking one of the following macros:

* `META_ENUM(TypeName)` to define an `enum` named `TypeName` in the current namespace
* `META_ENUM_CLASS(TypeName)` to define an `enum class`
* `META_ENUM_OF_TYPE(TypeName, underlying_type)` to define an `enum` with underlying type
    `underlying_type`
* `META_ENUM_CLASS_OF_TYPE(TypeName, underlying_type)` to define an `enum class` with underlying
    type `underlying_type`

A type `E` created by the `META_ENUM` macros can be used with the following functions:

* `char const *enum_member_name(E e)` returns the name of the value of `e` as a C string.
* `E enum_member_from_name<E>(char const *name)` returns the value of type `E` named by the C
    string `name`. The program aborts if there is no member of `E` named by `name`.

## durians/io.hpp

This header provides a thin wrapper over `cstdio`.

* Type aliases `unique_file` and `shared_file` are provided for `std::unique_ptr<FILE>` and
    `std::shared_ptr<FILE>` with deletion performed by `fclose`.
* `unique_file open_unique_file(char const *name, char const *mode)` and
    `shared_file open_shared_file(char const *name, char const *mode)` construct a
    `unique_file` or `shared_file` using `fopen`.
* `size_t write_file(FILE *f, slice<T> slice)` writes the data referenced by `slice` to the file
    `f` as if by `fwrite(slice.data(), slice.size(), sizeof(T), f)`.
* `size_t read_file(FILE *f, mutable_slice<T> slice)` reads data from `f` into the memory referenced
    by `slice` as if by `fread(slice.data(), slice.size(), sizeof(T), f)`.
    
## durians/maybe.hpp

This header defines a class template `maybe<T>` for representing optional values. `maybe<T>` is
laid out like a `struct { bool; T; };`; the `T` is uninitialized if no value is present. `T`
must be movable but does not need to be copyable or default-constructible. `maybe<T>` is always
movable, move-assignable, and default-constructible, and is copyable and copy-assignable if `T` is.
`maybe<T>` is standard-layout if `T` is standard-layout, and is trivially copy/move constructible,
assignable, and destructible if `T` is. `maybe<T>` is however never trivial because it defines
a nontrivial default constructor.

A specialization is provided for `maybe<T&>`, which is represented by a `T*` with `nullptr`
representing no value. `maybe<T&>` is always standard-layout and trivially copy/move constructible,
assignable, and destructible.

In addition to the standard value semantics methods, `maybe` types provide the following methods:

* `maybe<T>()` default-constructs a `maybe` containing no value.
* `maybe<T>(T const &)` and `maybe<T>(T &&)` construct a `maybe` containing a value copied or moved
    from a `T`.
* `explicit operator bool` returns true if a `maybe` contains a value.
* `operator*` returns a reference
    to the contained value; it is undefined if `operator*` is applied to a `maybe` containing no
    value.
* `operator=(T const &)` and `operator=(T &&)` assign a new value to the `maybe`.
    `operator=(std::nullptr_t)` discards the value inside a `maybe`, if any.

The following top-level functions are provided for working with `maybe` types:

* `just(x)` constructs a maybe containing the value `x` as if by `maybe<decltype(x)>(x)`.
* `when(m, if_true, if_false)` calls `if_true(*m)` if `m` contains a value or `if_false()` if
    `m` contains no value.
* `or_else(m, dflt)` evaluates to `*m` if `m` contains a value, or `dflt` if `m` contains no value.

## durians/misc.hpp

This header defines the following symbols:

* The macro `S_CAT(a,b)` tokenâ€“pastes the expansions of `a` and `b`.
* The macro `S_UNREACHABLE;` expands to a statement marking the current code path as unreachable
    by proper code execution.
* The macro `S_AUTO(...)` expands to `-> decltype(...) { return ...; }`. It can be used in place
    of a simple `auto` function body, for example:
    
        template<typename T, typename U> auto sum(T a, T b) S_AUTO(a + b);

* The template type alias `type<T>` is an alias to `T`. This alias can simplify declarations
    involving function and array types, for example:
    
        // traditional definition of signal
        void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);
        // equivalent definition using type<T> alias
        type<void(int)> *signal(int sig, type<void(int)> *func);

* The template class `static_function<R(A...), func>` is an empty functor type whose `operator()`
    invokes the function `R func(A...)`. This can be used to reference functions in template classes
    without runtime overhead, for example, as a deleter type for a `std::unique_ptr`:
    
        // unique_ptr to a buffer that should be deleted using free()
        unique_ptr<char[], static_function<void(void*), free>> buf = strdup("foo");
        
        // unique_ptr to a FILE that should be deleted using fclose()
        unique_ptr<FILE, static_function<int(FILE*), fclose>> file = fopen("/dev/null", "wb");

    The macro `S_STATIC_FUNCTION(f)` expands to `static_function<decltype(f), f>`; this can be used
    as a shorthand for referencing non-overloaded functions.

* The template class `only_same<A, B>` is like the type trait `std::is_same`, but is only defined
    in the case `only_same<A, A>`. The instantiation errors generated by `only_same<A, B>` can help
    diagnose bugs in template metaprograms.

## durians/packs.hpp

This header defines types and trait classes for manipulating variadic parameter packs.

* The template class `types<T...>` is an empty class referencing the type pack `T...`.
* The template class `values<T, N...>` is an empty class referencing the value pack `N...` of
    type `T`.
* The trait `is_type_in<T, TT...>::value` is true if `T` is a member of the pack `TT...`.
* The trait `type_index<T, TT...>::value` is equal to the index of `T` within `TT...`.
* The type alias `type_at<N, TT...>` is aliased to the `N`th type within `TT...`.
* The traits `is_any_type<Trait, TT...>::value` and `is_every_type<Trait, TT...>::value` are
    true if `Trait<T>::value` is true for any or every type `T` in `TT...`.
* The type alias `integers<N>` is aliased to `values<size_t, 0, 1, ..., N-1>`.

## durians/print.hpp

## durians/reftype.hpp

## durians/scope.hpp

This header defines macros for installing scope guard statements.

* `SCOPE_EXIT(statements);` will cause `statements` to be executed when the current scope is exited
    for any reason, whether by normal control flow or by a thrown exception.
* `SCOPE_SUCCESS(statements);` will cause `statements` to be executed when the current scope is
    exited by normal control flow.
* `SCOPE_FAILURE(statements);` will cause `statements` to be executed when the current scope is
    exited by a thrown exception.
    
For example:

```c++
char const *foo()
{
    char const *r = malloc(100);
    SCOPE_FAILURE(free(r)); // free r if we fail before returning it
    ...
    return r;
}

void bar()
{
    char const *r = malloc(100);
    SCOPE_EXIT(free(r)); // free r in any case
    ...
}

void bas()
{
    auto start = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    SCOPE_SUCCESS(println("bar succeeded in ",
                          chrono::duration_cast<chrono::nanoseconds>(chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - start),
                          "ns"));
    ...
}
```

## durians/slice.hpp

This header defines template types for slices, which are nonowning references to arrays of objects.
All slice can reference all or part of a C array, `std::array`, `std::vector`, `std::string`, or
other sequence of objects that is contiguous in memory.

The type `basic_slice<T>` is a reference to an array of `T`. The type alias `slice<T>` is aliased
to `basic_slice<T const>`, and `mutable_slice<T>` to `basic_slice<T>`. Slice types are implicitly
convertible from C arrays, `std::array`, `std::vector`, and `std::initializer_list`. `slice<T>`
is also conditionally convertible from `mutable_slice<T>`. Slice types
are trivially copyable, movable, assignable, and destructible; copying the slice does not copy
the referenced data. Slice types fulfill the requirements of an STL Random Access Sequence using
`T*` as the iterator type.

Slice types provide the following additional constructors:

* `basic_slice<T>(T &value)` constructs a slice of size 1 referencing the single object `value`.
* `basic_slice<T>(T *data, size_t size)` constructs a slice referencing `size` objects starting with
    the one pointed to by `data`.
* `basic_slice<T>(T *begin, T *end)` constructs a slice referencing the objects in the half-open range
    `[begin, end)`.

A function `make_slice` is also provided to construct a `slice<T>` with the type `T` inferred from
the constructor arguments.

A type `string_slice` is defined for referring to strings. `string_slice` inherits from `slice<char>`,
and provides additional conversions from `char const *` and `std::string` and comparison operators
for comparing strings. Note that since `string_slice` can refer into the middle of a string, it
cannot be assumed to be null-terminated.

## durians/struct_meta.hpp

This header provides preprocessor macros for defining `struct` types with metaprogramming support
for the struct's fields. To define a struct, define a macro named `META_FIELDS_TypeName(field)` as
follows:

```c++
#define META_FIELDS_TypeName(field) \
    field(foo, int) \
    field(bar, float) \
    field(bas, char)
```

Then invoke the macro `META_STRUCT(TypeName)` to define a struct named `TypeName` in the current
namespace. A type `T` created by `META_STRUCT` can be used with the following functions:

* `each_field_metadata<T, Trait>(f)` will invoke a function object callable as
    `void f(char const *name, size_t size, size_t offset, decltype(Trait<U>::value()) trait)`
    with the name, `sizeof`, `offsetof`, and type trait of each field in the struct type `T`.
    For example:
    
        #define META_FIELDS_Foo(field) \
            field(foo, int) \
            field(bar, float)
        META_STRUCT(Foo)
        
        struct get_typeid<T> { static char const *value() { return typeid(T).name(); } };
        
        void describe_field(char const *name, size_t size, size_t offset, char const *id)
        {
            printf("field %s, size %zu, offset %zu, typeid %s\n",
                   name, size, offset, id);
        }
        
        int main()
        {
            each_field_metadata<Foo>(describe_field);
        }
        
* `each_field(instance, f)` will invoke a function object `f` with a reference to every field in
    `instance`. `f` must have an `operator()` for every field type in `instance`. For example:
    
        #define META_FIELDS_Foo(field) \
            field(foo, int) \
            field(bar, float)
        META_STRUCT(Foo)

        struct set_to_one {
            template<typename T>
            void operator()(T &x)
            {
                x = 1;
            }
        };
        
        int main()
        {
            Foo foo;
            each_field(foo, set_to_one());
        }

The trait classes `aggregate_size<T>` and `aggregate_element<N, T>` are also defined. These
are supersets of `std::tuple_size` and `std::tuple_element`; in addition to being defined for
`std::tuple`, `std::pair`, and `std::array`, `aggregate_size` and `aggregate_element` are
also provided for structs defined by `META_STRUCT`. `aggregate_size<T>::value` is equal to
the number of fields in `T`, and `typename aggregate_element<N, T>::type` is aliased to the type
of the `N`th field in `T`. `get<N>(instance)` will give a reference to the `N`th field in `instance`.
The type trait `is_aggregate<T>::value` is true if `aggregate_size`, `aggregate_element`, and
`get` are valid for the type `T`.
